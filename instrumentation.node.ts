/**
 * Node-only startup work (imported conditionally from `instrumentation.ts`).
 *
 * Per Next.js docs (guides/instrumentation + open-telemetry "Manual
 * configuration"), `register` runs in both Node and Edge, so Node-only code
 * must live in a separate `instrumentation.node` file imported only when
 * `NEXT_RUNTIME === 'nodejs'`. An early return inside one file is
 * runtime-only: Turbopack still builds the Edge variant, sees the transitive
 * `node:*`/`fs`/`path` imports (model-config, secret-box, storage reference
 * server, media adapters) and spams "not supported in the Edge Runtime"
 * warnings on every dev boot. Splitting keeps the Edge bundle to one
 * conditional dynamic import.
 *
 * `registerNode` must return before the server is ready, so nothing here may
 * block on I/O. Starting a timer does not.
